# Share Document Bug Fixes - Test Guide

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Critical Permission Bug: No Read-Only Mode Enforcement** ✅
- **Fix**: Added `isReadOnly` prop to Editor component that disables editing when user has viewer-only permissions
- **Test**: Share a document with viewer role and verify the user cannot edit the document

### 2. **User List Display Bug** ✅
- **Fix**: Added fallback user display for deleted/missing users
- **Test**: Share with a user, then delete that user from Clerk, and verify they still show in permissions list as "Usuário removido"

### 3. **Self-Share Prevention** ✅
- **Fix**: Added server-side validation to prevent users from sharing with themselves
- **Fix**: Filter out current user from the share dropdown
- **Test**: Try to share a document with yourself - should not appear in dropdown

### 4. **Already Shared Users Still Appear in Dropdown** ✅
- **Fix**: Filter out already shared users from the dropdown
- **Test**: Share with a user, then open share dialog again - that user should not appear in dropdown

### 5. **No Loading State for Permission List** ✅
- **Fix**: Added loading state while fetching permissions
- **Test**: Open share dialog and observe loading state before permissions load

### 6. **Missing Error Handling** ✅
- **Fix**: Added proper error handling for edge cases
- **Test**: Try various error scenarios (network issues, etc.)

## Additional Improvements
